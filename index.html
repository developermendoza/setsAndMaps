    <h1>Sets and Maps</h1>
    <p><b>Sets:</b></p>
    <p>
      A Set is a collection of unique values where each value must be distinct.
      In other words, it doesn't allow duplicate elements. Sets are iterable,
      and the order of elements is based on insertion order
    </p>
    <p><b>Maps:</b></p>
    <p>
      A Map is a collection of key-value pairs where each key must be unique.
      Unlike objects, keys in a Map can be of any data type, including objects
      and primitive values. Maps are iterable, and the order of elements is
      based on insertion order.
